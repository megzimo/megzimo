        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Meg, and I am a former science teacher looking forward to changing careers into technology.
            I have been learning how to code on my own for the last 4 months, and am so excited to be a part of UT's Coding
            Bootcamp! </p>
        <p>Besides my newfound interest in coding, I am a food fanatic - baking and cooking are some of my favorite things to
            do. I am also a gardener, with raised-bed vegetable gardens along with a few flower beds. I love hiking and camping,
            and hope to move to Colorado in the next few years.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to know more or are intersted in getting in touch with me, click on the contact me button to send me
            a message - I'd love to hear from you!</p>
